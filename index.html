<p>This project adds to previous exploration of the relationship between baby naming and social and ideological trends in the United States. Specifically, we evaluate the relationship between religious naming traditions, religiosity, and voting patterns in the U.S. since the emergence of the current political structure in the mid 1900s. We observed a relationship between the preponderance of biblical names in a state and levels of Christian affiliation in that state. This relationship motivated further analyses: as previous research points to a positive relationship between Christianity and voting Republican in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, we investigated the relationship between Judeo-Christian naming and presidential voting patterns in a given year and on a time delay. We were able to build effective predictive models for Republican voting patterns in a subset of states, suggesting biblical names may be indicative of social trends associated with social conservatism in some regions of the United States. However, this relationship may be reflective of confounding factors (such as population density), and the same-year relationship provides less unique information than a time-lagged assessment of the electorate, limiting the utility of this model.</p>
